            <h3>(Pterodactyls are actually not dinosaurs!)</h3>
            <br>
            <p> Pterodactylus is a genus of pterosaurs, which were flying reptiles from the Mesozoic Era. While commonly
                referred to as 'pterodactyls,' it's important to clarify that 'pterodactyl' is not a specific scientific
                term for all pterosaurs. Instead, it's often used to describe various species of ancient flying
                reptiles.
                Pterosaurs constituted a diverse group of reptiles that independently evolved
                powered flight, distinct from birds and bats.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Pterosaurs were flying reptiles that lived during the time of the dinosaurs. They were around from 210
                to
                65 million years ago. They were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight, and they were the
                largest animals to ever fly. Pterosaurs were not dinosaurs, but they were closely related to them. They
                were more closely related to crocodiles and birds than to dinosaurs.</p>
            <br>
            <p> There were many different species of pterosaurs. Some were as small as a sparrow, and some were as big
                as
                modern giraffes with a wingspan reaching 30 feet wide</p>

                        <p>These ancient reptiles appeared to be capable of multiple modes of locomotion. Pterosaurs
                            were skilled fliers
                            with powerful flight muscles. It is estimated that they reached cruising speeds of roughly
                            90 kilometres per
                            hour (km/h), even achieving speeds above 100 km/h for a few minutes. Some pterosaurs are
                            also believed to have
                            been able to swim, due to many of their fossils being found seaside, evidence of swim
                            tracks, and some
                            pterosaur diets consisting of aquatic prey. Despite their affinity for aquatic environments,
                            research exploring
                            pterosaur biomechanics suggests it is unlikely they were adept at simply floating on the
                            surface of the water.
                            They were also able to move about on land, with some species possibly even using all four
                            limbs to walk, a
                            hypothesis based on the fossilized terrestrial trackways of their footprints.</p>

                        <p>The first known pterosaur species appeared during the Late Triassic period. In addition to
                            them being much older
                            than people used to think, they were also much more diverse than previously thought. Since
                            to date, there are over 100 different species of pterosaurs
                            that have been discovered!
